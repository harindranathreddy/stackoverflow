## Business understanding
Let’s say you work for the company Stack Overflow, which is the largest and most trusted online forum for developers to learn, share their skills and build their careers. It is one of the most popular websites for developers, data engineers, and data scientists for getting their technical queries answered. More than 50 million experienced and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow every month to help users resolve the errors that they encounter while programming and develop new skills. Their products and services focus on developer marketing, technical recruitment, market research, and enterprise knowledge sharing.

Stack Overflow maintains a website where different users with membership ask and answer questions on various technical topics. The format of such queries includes the title, the body, and the tag of the question. These questions can be answered by any user.

## Objective:
Using EDA, help Stack Overflow implement the following features in its web application:

When a user raises a question with a data science tag ('Python', 'R', 'Matlab, 'SAS', 'Excel', 'SQL'), then Stack Overflow sends the notification to the relevant users.

When a user provides a data science tag ('Python', 'R', 'Matlab, 'SAS', 'Excel', 'SQL) to their question, then Stack Overflow should come up with the expected approximate time to get it answered.

While a user raises a question, Stack Overflow wants to provide some suggestions to the users to get their queries answered quickly.

Let’s say Stack Overflow also wants to post some details on its job website to help various employees understand the subjects or topics trending in the industry.
